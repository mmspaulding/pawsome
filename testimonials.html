          <p class="review">"When my parents told me they were going to Europe for a month during Christmas, I was really sad. That's a long time! They told me not to worry because Michele from Pawsome was coming to spend time with me. Michele came every day. We had so much fun playing with my toys, and I got treats when I was good. The time flew by! Michele also took a lot of pictures for me. I felt so special! I'm so glad I met Michele."</p>

          <p class="review">"The only thing better than cuddling with my bear, is cuddling with Michele. When my mom isn't around I cry a lot, but Michele gave me so much love."</p>

          <p class="review">"I love when my parents leave me alone because I can get into trouble! Now they have this person Michele coming. She plays with me so much that I get really sleepy. When my parents come back, I wake up and realize that I haven't messed anything up at all! >_<"</p>

          <p class="review">"I don't really like cuddles, but I love looking outside. Michele opened the windows for me, and even though I didn't want her to pet me she still came to visit me. I was glad to see her."</p>
